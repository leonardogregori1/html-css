    <h1>Paragraphs & line break</h1>
    <p>
      You can write an paragraph anyway you want. Just put everything that you
      want to write inside the opening and closing paragraph tags.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to break a text in a specific point, you can use the line
      break tag: &lt;br&gt;.
      <!--&lt - LESS THAN // &gt - GREATER THAN -->
      <br />For example, this is the first line after the break row tag. <br />
      And this is the second line after another break row tag.
