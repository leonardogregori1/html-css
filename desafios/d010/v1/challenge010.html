          <h3>THE FIRST VERSION</h2>
          <p>
            The first attempt to create a mascot came in 2007 from a developer
            named <a href="">Dan Morrill</a>. He recounts that he opened
            <a href="">Inkscape</a> (free software for vectorizing images) and
            created his own robot version. The goal was simply to personify the
            system for his team; there was no request from the company to create
            a mascot.

          <p>
            This first bizarre version was even named in honor of its creator:
            they would be called the <strong>Dandroids</strong>.

          <h3>APPEARS A NEW MASCOT</h3>
          <p>
            The idea of ​​having a mascot matured, and the mission was passed on
            to a professional in the field. Russian illustrator
            <a href="">Irina Blok</a>, also a Google employee, was given the
            task of representing the little robot in a more appealing way.
          </p>
          <picture>
            <source
              media="(max-width: 850px )"
              srcset="imagens/irina-blok-pq.jpg"
              type="image/jpeg"
            />

            <img src="imagens/irina-blok.jpg" alt="Irina Blok Photo" />
          </picture>
          <p>
            Irina's main idea was to represent everything graphically with few
            lines and in a flatter style. The design should also generate quick
            identification with the viewer. Thus, <strong>Bugdroid</strong>, the
            new Android mascot, was born.
          </p>
          <img src="imagens/bugdroid.png" alt="Bugdroid Image" />
          <p>
            The main inspiration for the new Bugdroid's design came from those
            little figures that illustrate bathroom doors to indicate the gender
            of each stall. Legend has it that the artist was creating at her
            desk in the Google office and looked towards the bathrooms, and the
            connection was immediate: simple, clean, objective.

                <li>9.0 - Pie</li>
              </ul>

              <p>Unfortunately, Android Q never existed, as Google decided to end this fun practice and started using numbering, which gave rise to Android 10.</p>
